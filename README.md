#ScFlow Modules
(created as part of submission of my final year university project "ScFlow: Optimizing Software Engineering Practices for Modular and Extensible Bioinformatics Pipelines")

This repository contains packages I created in order to test the idea of splitting the ScFlow R package into smaller modules where each module handles a different stage of the ScFlow pipeline.
The code published here informed chapters 5.2 and 6.1.1 of the project reoprt.
