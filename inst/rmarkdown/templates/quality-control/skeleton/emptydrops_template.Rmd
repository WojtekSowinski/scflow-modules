A total of `r prettyNum(sum(metadata$qc_summary$qc_cells_n_cells_passed, metadata$qc_summary$qc_cells_n_cells_failed), big.mark = ",")` barcodes were submitted to the ambient RNA / empty droplet identification method *emptyDrops*.  This identified `r prettyNum(metadata$emptydrops_params$cells_found, big.mark = ",")` cells and `r prettyNum(metadata$emptydrops_params$emptydrops_found, big.mark = ",")` empty droplets with an FDR cutoff of ≤ `r sprintf("%1.2f%%", metadata$emptydrops_params$alpha_cutoff * 100)`.  `r if(!(toupper(metadata$emptydrops_params$retain_param) == "AUTO") & !is.null(metadata$emptydrops_params$retain_param)) {sprintf("The retain parameter was set to %s, therefore all barcodes with at least %s counts were assumed to contain cells.", metadata$emptydrops_params$retain, metadata$emptydrops_params$retain)}` `r if(is.null(metadata$emptydrops_params$retain)) {sprintf("The retain parameter was set to NULL, therefore the retain parameter was set to the total counts at the barcode rank knee point (%s) (i.e. all barcodes with at least %s counts were assumed to contain cells).", metadata$emptydrops_params$retain, metadata$emptydrops_params$retain)}` `r if(toupper(metadata$emptydrops_params$retain_param) == "AUTO") {sprintf("The retain parameter was set to 'auto', therefore the retain parameter was calculated as m/10 (%s) where m is the 99th percentile of the top %s (expect_cells parameter) barcodes by total UMI counts (i.e. all barcodes with greater than %s counts were retained as cells).", metadata$emptydrops_params$retain, metadata$emptydrops_params$expect_cells, metadata$emptydrops_params$retain)}`

### Monte-Carlo Iterations
The EmptyDrops algorithm was run with the specified `r prettyNum(metadata$emptydrops_params$niters, big.mark = ",")` Monte-Carlo iterations for the calculation of p-values.  `r if(metadata$emptydrops_params$n_limited > 0){sprintf("It was found that the p-values of %s non-significant cells were limited by the number of iterations, suggesting that a higher number of iterations would improve the cell / empty droplet calls.", metadata$emptydrops_params$n_limited)} else {sprintf("No barcodes were observed to have p-values limited by the number of iterations, suggesting that %s iterations was suitable for cell / empty droplet calling on this data.", prettyNum(metadata$emptydrops_params$niters, big.mark = ","))}`

### Ambient Profile
To evaluate whether the model was reliable, the p-values for all presumed ambient barcodes (i.e. total_counts <`r metadata$emptydrops_params$lower`) were extracted.  Under the null hypothesis, the p-values for these barcodes should be uniformly distributed.

```{r, fig.align="center", fig.width=8, fig.height=4, fig.cap = sprintf("<b>Figure: Distribution of p-values for low total-count barcodes. </b>Ideally this distribution should be close to uniform.  Large peaks near zero would suggest that barcodes with fewer _total_counts_ than the *lower* parameter (lower = %s) are not all ambient.  In this case, further decreasing the *lower* parameter is recommended to ensure that barcodes representing genuine cells with relatively low expression are not used to estimate the ambient profile.", metadata$emptydrops_params$lower)}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
#ggplotly(metadata$emptydrops_plots$emptydrops_hist)
metadata$emptydrops_plots$emptydrops_hist
```

In addition to this visualization, the uniformity was tested using the `r metadata$emptydrops_params$uniformity_method` which yielded a _p-value_ of `r metadata$emptydrops_params$uniformity_pval` (≤0.05 would suggest non-uniformity).
